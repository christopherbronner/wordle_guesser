After each guess, the player receives color-coded feedback on each of the five letters of the guessed word: (1) a green letter indicates that this letter occurs in the hidden word at this position, (2) a yellow letter indicates that this letter occurs in the hidden word at a different position, (3) a gray letter doesn't appear in the hidden word.\n",
